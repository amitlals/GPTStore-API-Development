OpenAI GPTs Assistant API Examples
Welcome to the repository showcasing examples utilizing OpenAI tools. I strongly recommend running through the provided sample code and viewing the referenced instructional videos for a comprehensive understanding. Thanks to the video creaters for sharing their knowledge.

Prerequisites:
Obtain an OpenAI API Key: Secure and save your OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-' in an .env file. You can obtain your API key from OpenAI API-keys.
Obtain Other API Keys: I also used Google API and Airtable API in the final example, but it is possible to modify the code and skip those.
Install Proper Tools and Packages
Note: APIs typically require putting a card on file, and it's crucial to set a spending limit to avoid unintended charges!

Implementing Auction Schema for GPTs
Enhance your GPTs with an auction schema. This requires simple copy-pasting into the OpenAI URL.

Sample Schema/Instruction 'Code': Weather GPTs Python Script
Reference Videos: YouTube Tutorial
GPT End Result: OpenAI Chat Interface
Pros:
Ease of Implementation: A straightforward process.
Minimal Coding: Little to no coding is required.
Ready-to-Use Interface: Immediate access to a user-friendly interface.
Cons:
Auction and Schema Clarity: The details of the auction schema might not be clear (at least to me).
Integration Limitations: Currently lacks the ability to integrate with external systems or link to websites outside the OpenAI ecosystem.
